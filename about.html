In doing this, our goal is to assist our users color identification accuracy of objects on screen. Because high-contrast color systems for displays already exist that assist the user in differentiating between objects of similar color on screen, we hope to be able to assist in not only our users ability to differentiate between objcets of similar color(s) but also assist in them so that they can confidently and accuractely identify colors on their personal displays.</p>

            <p class="about-paragraphs">We hope that we are able to assist our users browser based experiences. By taking our survey, we can collect your color vision data and compute the difference in the rgb value you are perceiving as the color of an object on screen and the "true" rgb value of said object on screen.</p>
            <p class="about-paragraphs">From there we can apply that difference calculated from your survey data to the rgb pixel values that your browser is outputting to your display to help improve your user experience.With this personalized correction we hope we are able to assist you not only in your ability but your confidence in correctly identifying the the colors of objects seen on your display.</p>
